**WHAT IS AFFILIATE MARKETING?**

Simply put, affiliate marketing to promote other people's products. If you know someone else's product successfully promotes and ensures that the consumer buys the product through your website, you get a percentage commission for this. So you have no own product, but you promote the products of others.

This is done by a special affiliate link to place on your website. This then links to the product you're promoting. By using a special affiliate link, the visitor can be precisely measured is through your website, and so you will get commissions when consumers buy the product.

You're like a middleman!

These products can be anything. It may be (mobile) phones, concert tickets, shoes or even applications for a contest.

**HOW CAN YOU CREATE AN AFFILIATE LINK?**

To measure where the visitor comes from (your website, the website of the product you promote) you have to have a special affiliate link. This is a link containing your personal code. There are several services that you can do that.

You must sign up for that with an affiliate network. These affiliate networks make it possible to create a special affiliate link without you there any technical knowledge needed. Personally, I recommend to use Daisycon as an affiliate network. This system I find it easiest to work, and the service is really very good.

Below is a list of affiliate networks:

[CJ Affiliate by Conversant (formerly Commission Junction)](http://cj.com/)

[ClickBank](http://clickbank.com/)

[JVZoo](http://jvzoo.com/) (Internet marketing niche)

**EARNING AFFILIATE MARKETING**

There are several affiliate marketing revenue models, namely:

**PPC (pay per click)** - here you get a certain fee if a visitor clicks on the promotion of your website.

**PPL (pay per lead)** - here you do get eg a fee for a visitor to participate in a contest, and thereby data leaves the advertiser.

**CPS (click per sale)** - here you get a fee when the visitor actually actually bought the promoted product. This is often a high cost.

You can have complete control of what business model you will use. It is wise to match the earnings on your website.

Do you have for example a website in which you compare products, then it is wise to hang behind a CPS model. For example, you make an affiliate link to the product that you are comparing, and if the visitor then buys the product through your affiliate link, you get paid for it!
