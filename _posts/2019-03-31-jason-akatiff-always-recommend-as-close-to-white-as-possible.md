1)Self-intro

Jason Akatiff, San Diego, California. I started in Affiliate Marketing in 2003. I run traffic to around 100 verticals and used all the main traffic sources. Over the years I’ve driven traffic with Facebook, Google, Display, DSP, Native, Pops and the list goes on.

2) Changes in traffic types / verticals from last year?

In the last year or so we’ve been focused heavily on Facebook ads. So far for the first of 2019 it’s been a rocky road on the Ecommerce side for FB ads. However all our financial newsletter stuff is doing quite well on Facebook.

Snapchat people keep talking about, but the audience is just small in comparison to Google or Facebook. I think Google will be a lot of the focus this year as Facebook continues to have rapid increases in prices and conversion unpredictability due to all their data issues.

3) Blackhat vs . Whitehat?

I’d always recommend as close to white as possible, as channels are getting better and better with AI every year. Is it still possible to beat the system? Of course. But that cat and mouse game is going to continue to get harder. And when you are successful at it, it will need to be massively profitable. Which unfortunately, a lot of times, means stealing from people. Not creating value.

4) Which traffic types / verticals are thriving/dying?

All the talk of the town has been CBD. As legalization continues to press forward I think we’re going to see lots of opportunity in this space. Hopefully the rest of the traffic channels will open up like Snapchat just did. Ecommerce will always be strong.

There’s a slow progression from offline to online and we still have a LONG way to go. Did you know only 10% of retail transactions happen online?

5) Which traffic source/type and vertical if starting this year?

I would probably focus on Native and Google. Facebook has been really unstable as a channel. We’re not seeing account issues so far in 2019 as we have in other years. However the profitability of campaigns has been much less stable. We’ll see swings of 100-200% in conversion rates and click costs day over day.
