There are tons of affiliate programs to choose from out there. Just type “affiliate program” or “affiliate network” into a Google search and you will get tons of affiliate programs. You can find affiliate programs for almost anything you can think of.

But all that aside. There are a couple of major affiliate networks worth mentioning in this answer.

1. [ClickBank](http://www.clickbank.com/) - By far the most well known affiliate network for digital products
2. [JVZoo](https://www.jvzoo.com/) - I would say this is a close second to clickbank with tons of affiliate products to promote.
3. [Amazon Associates](https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/) - By far the best affiliate program for physical products
4. [MaxBounty](http://www.maxbounty.com/) - Maybe the best know affiliate network for CPA (cost per action/acquisition) offers
5. [PeerFly](https://peerfly.com/) - Also a great affiliate network for CPA offers

This is just a small list of some of the best affiliate networks out there.
