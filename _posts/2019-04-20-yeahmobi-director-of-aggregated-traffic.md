1)Self-intro

Yeahmobi is aiming to providing the best solutions to both supply and demand sides. Our business model spans from CPI, CPR, CPE to CPS, consisting of the following verticals: Entertainment, utility, ecommerce, games, health, dating, etc. We were established in 2012.

2)Are carrier-billing offers dead?

Yes they are. We had already paused subscription offers. The one who made the prediction is correct.

3)Best verticals for mobile? Performance on 3G vs . Wifi?

We could see very good performance on games and ecommerce, and also short video apps like tiktok. For the moment we have not found much difference between 3G and wifi.

4)Rising and declining verticals?

We can see an obvious increase in loan products in SEA geos.

5)Stable and lucrative verticals?

Payday loan products.

6)Blackhat vs . whitehat?

White hat ones will go more stable and further, and is good to the advertising arena. Black hat can make money in a very short time, but will be more harmful to users.
