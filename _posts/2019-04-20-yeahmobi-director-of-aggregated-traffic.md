**Affiliate marketing: what is it?**

The first thing that comes to your mind when defining eCommerce is selling goods online. But "selling" means much more than making sales and doing marketing for your store.

* Finding the right manufacturer or setting up production on your own;
* Shipping all goods on time and to the right people;
* Taking care of payments and taxes;
* Warehousing and storing;
* Customer service.

Not much time left to actually do marketing and sales. Affiliate marketers selling your product may become one more sales channel that does not require much time and taking too many risks.

When having set up affiliate system your main purpose is getting more traffic, preferably your target audience. Working with affiliates you create a network of people interested in promoting your business. It's like your own sales army.
